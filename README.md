# opengl_cpp_vscode_sample
Code example to test your VSCode C++ OpenGL setup with GLFW/GLAD.  
Done on Windows, with the g++ compiler.

## How to use this repo
- watch [this video](youtube.com).
- main.cpp is an example file for GLFW/GLAD use (for OpenGL 3.3). Just copy its content if you don't already have a cpp file.  
- tasks.json is the VSCode file (put it in .vscode/) which tells how to build the exe. Change the paths given so they match your repo structure and compiler location.

#### ImGui
There's another branch "imgui" with similar samples, but with ImGui as well.
